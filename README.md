# ECON-714: Problem Set I

## Problem 1: Github
The Github repo for the project is [here](https://github.com/haksoo92/econ714-pset-1).


## Problem 2: Integration
```python
integrateMidpoint(a, b, n, rrho, llambda)
integrateTrapezoid(a, b, n, rrho, llambda)
integrateSimpson(a, b, n, rrho, llambda)
```
define numerical integrations using the midpoint, trapezoid, Simpson's rules and a Monte Carlo.
The documentations are included in 
```bash
helloWorld.py
```

Figure 1 shows compute-time performance comparision with respect to the number of intervals in estimation. In particular, it shows that the trapezoid rule is the fastest and the Monte Carlo method the slowest.

Figure 2 shows numerical acuracyt performance comparison with respect to the number of intervals in estimation. In particular, it shows that the Monte Carlo method is relatively inaccurate in lower N buy converges to the estimates of other methods as N grows.
